So the prompt given to chatgpt was 
"can you take my resume as input and parse content in a json format?"
the reply was
"Yes, I can help with that. Please provide your resume, and I'll parse the content into a JSON format for you. You can either paste the text here or upload a file."
I uploaded my resume and the result is in the file called JSON code
